At some time, some version of Merc has been built and executed on each of these
platforms.  We hope we have collected all of the changes and ported them back
into the base code successfully.

The MsDos version is built with DJ Delorie's 'djgpp' port of the Gnu C
Compiler.  It supports only one user (on the console).

Traditional (non-Ansi) C compilers are now supported via 'mktrad'.  See
'trad.txt'.



=== Requirements

The hardware requirements are essentially: two megabytes of memory; five
megabytes of disk space; any 32-bit processor; 50 kilobits per second network
bandwidth.  Processor speed is not important.

The software requirements are essentially: a C compiler (Ansi C preferred,
but Merc can be made to work with 'mktrad'); a Unix or Unix-like operating
system; BSD-compatible TCP/IP networking.



=== Performance

All this measured on a Sun 4 with SunOS 4.1.2.

Boot time:    4  CPU seconds.
Memory:       2  megabytes SZ size.
CPU usage:    30 CPU seconds per hour (no players).
Disk space:   3  megabytes plus 4K per player file.
IP packets:   about 10 per second with 20 people logged in.
