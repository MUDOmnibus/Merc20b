=== Merc-Based Sites

The following muds are based on Merc code.  The implementors of these muds add
their own changes and features, so don't expect all these muds to look alike.

To the imps who run these muds ... thanks for sharing your computers with us
all!

If you would like to be added to (or removed from) to this list, just e-mail
Furey, Hatchet, or Kahn.
